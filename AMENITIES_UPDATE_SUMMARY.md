### 🔍 Backend Integration:

- ✅ All API calls use correct endpoints: `/api/amenities/admin/:adminId/*`
- ✅ Update API: `PUT /api/amenities/admin/:adminId/amenity/:amenityId`
- ✅ Delete API: `DELETE /api/amenities/admin/:adminId/amenity/:amenityId`
- ✅ Admin ID retrieved dynamically from AdminSessionService
- ✅ Proper error handling for network issues
- ✅ JSON parsing with fallback error handling

### 🛡️ Error Prevention:

- ✅ Image loading errors are caught and display fallback UI
- ✅ Network errors show user-friendly messages
- ✅ Form validation prevents invalid data submission
- ✅ Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous operations
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions

### 📱 UI Enhancements:

- ✅ Loading indicators during operations
- ✅ Color-coded success/error messages
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Proper form validation
- ✅ Image preview with loading states
- ✅ Consistent styling across all components
