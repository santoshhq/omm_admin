# 🔧 Amenities Backend Integration Guide

## Problem Identified:
The Flutter app is successfully connecting to your backend server at `localhost:8080`, but the amenities API endpoints are returning 404 errors:
```
Cannot GET /api/admin-amenities/admin/68d664d7d84448fff5dc3a8b
```

This means your backend server is running, but the amenities routes are not registered.

## Solution:
You need to integrate the amenities routes into your main backend server.

## Files to Copy to Your Backend Server:

### 1. Copy these files to your backend project:

📁 **Your Backend Project Structure Should Look Like:**
```
your-backend-project/
├── server.js (or app.js - your main server file)
├── controllers/
│   └── amenitiesController.js  ← Copy backend_amenities_controller.js here
├── routes/
│   └── admin-amenities.js      ← Copy backend_amenities_routes.js here
└── models/
    └── Amenity.js             ← Create this model file
```

### 2. Database Model (Create this file in your backend):

**File:** `models/Amenity.js`
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const amenitySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  createdByAdminId: { 
    type: String, 
    required: true 
  },
  name: { 
    type: String, 
    required: true 
  },
  description: { 
    type: String, 
    required: true 
  },
  capacity: { 
    type: Number, 
    required: true 
  },
  imagePaths: [{ 
    type: String 
  }],
  location: { 
    type: String, 
    required: true 
  },
  hourlyRate: { 
    type: Number, 
    required: true 
  },
  features: [{ 
    type: String 
  }],
  active: { 
    type: Boolean, 
    default: true 
  }
}, {
  timestamps: true
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Amenity', amenitySchema);
```

### 3. Register Routes in Your Main Server File:

**Add this to your main `server.js` or `app.js` file:**
```javascript
// Import the amenities routes
const adminAmenitiesRoutes = require('./routes/admin-amenities');

// Register the routes (add this with your other route registrations)
app.use('/api/admin-amenities', adminAmenitiesRoutes);
```

## Complete Integration Steps:

### Step 1: Copy Controller File
Copy `backend_amenities_controller.js` from this Flutter project to your backend project as `controllers/amenitiesController.js`

### Step 2: Copy Routes File  
Copy `backend_amenities_routes.js` from this Flutter project to your backend project as `routes/admin-amenities.js`

### Step 3: Create Database Model
Create the `models/Amenity.js` file with the schema above

### Step 4: Update Your Main Server File
Add the route registration code to your main server file

### Step 5: Restart Your Backend Server
```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
node server.js
# OR
npm start
```

## Verification:

After integrating, test these endpoints:

1. **GET** `http://localhost:8080/api/admin-amenities/admin/YOUR_ADMIN_ID`
2. **POST** `http://localhost:8080/api/admin-amenities/create`

## Flutter App Changes (Already Done):

✅ Updated API configuration to match backend structure
✅ Added proper error handling for image loading
✅ Integrated AdminSessionService for dynamic admin IDs
✅ Updated amenities API calls with correct parameters

## Expected Result:

After integration, the Flutter app should:
1. ✅ Load amenities without 404 errors
2. ✅ Create new amenities successfully
3. ✅ Display amenities with images correctly
4. ✅ Show proper loading and error states

**Current Status**: Flutter app is ready, just needs backend routes integration.
